# 🔐 Network Guard  
### AI-Based DDoS Detection and Automated Network Defense System

Network Guard is an intelligent cybersecurity solution designed to detect and mitigate Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks in real time using machine learning. The system continuously monitors network traffic, identifies anomalous behavior, and automatically blocks malicious sources to ensure reliable and secure network operations.

This project was developed for hackathon and research purposes, with a strong focus on cybersecurity automation, resilience, and scalable network protection.
